              <p>The evolution of agriculture has seen a significant shift from traditional labor-intensive methods to precision farming powered by modern technologies. Researchers have extensively studied the use of drones for crop monitoring, aerial imaging, and disease detection. Studies highlight how drones equipped with multispectral cameras and advanced navigation algorithms enable efficient, autonomous field coverage while providing high-resolution data for assessing crop health. Similarly, the integration of machine learning for plant disease identification through image processing has gained momentum, allowing early intervention and improved yield protection.</p>
              <p>In parallel, IoT-based soil monitoring systems have been explored in various agricultural research works. Deploying ground sensors for real-time data collection on nutrient levels (NPK), temperature, and humidity helps farmers make informed decisions on irrigation and fertilization. Communication technologies like LoRa have been identified as optimal for long-range, low-power data transmission in rural environments. Cloud platforms like Firebase are commonly used for real-time data storage and visualization. While these systems provide valuable insights, they often operate in isolation from aerial surveillance or automated response mechanisms.</p>
              <p>Despite the promising advancements in drone and IoT technologies, the literature reveals a gap in fully integrated, automated systems that combine aerial monitoring, soil sensing, targeted spraying, and secure communication within a single solution. Most existing implementations focus on one element, either drone imaging, IoT sensing, or spraying, without end-to-end coordination.  </p>
              <p>Moreover, concerns about communication reliability, system scalability, and data security remain under-addressed. The Smart Dragri System fills this gap by offering a unified platform that integrates drone navigation, disease detection, IoT-based soil monitoring, automated pesticide application, and secure dashboard communication, paving the way for a more sustainable and intelligent agricultural future.</p>

                <div>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Most studies in precision agriculture utilize drones for imaging and mapping, but lack adaptive, real-time path-planning algorithms that can handle complex, obstacle-filled field environments. Existing solutions typically follow static flight paths, resulting in incomplete crop coverage and inefficient energy use. Additionally, these systems often require manual control or frequent operator input. The Smart Dragri System overcomes this by simulating intelligent drone navigation using the A* algorithm, capable of dynamic re-routing and full field coverage without human intervention.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">While IoT applications in agriculture have shown promise, many implementations focus solely on individual parameters like soil moisture or temperature. There remains a gap in the use of low-cost, multi-sensor IoT systems that provide real-time soil nutrition (NPK) monitoring and disease feedback integrated with aerial imaging. Furthermore, most research lacks seamless data synchronization with cloud platforms, and fails to operate efficiently in connectivity-poor regions. Our system addresses this by using LoRa-based communication and cloud integration, ensuring reliable, real-time field data access. </p>

                        Although some work has been done on automated pesticide spraying, current solutions are rarely connected to real-time disease maps or prior spraying data. They tend to spray uniformly, wasting chemicals and increasing cost. Additionally, many systems lack memory-aware spraying logic and secure communication protocols. There’s a notable research gap in combining automation with data security in smart farming. The Smart Dragri System integrates AES-128 encryption with a memory-based spray controller, ensuring safe, targeted pesticide application only where it's needed.

            <h4 class="highlight">How can farmers monitor large-scale crop fields in real time, detect diseases early, and apply pesticides efficiently using an integrated and automated system without relying on manual labor or constant internet connectivity ?</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Agricultural productivity continues to be impacted by delayed disease detection, inefficient pesticide use, and limited access to real-time field data. Farmers often rely on manual field inspections, leading to late interventions and overuse of chemicals, which increases cost and environmental harm. Moreover, existing smart agriculture solutions are often fragmented drones, IoT sensors, and spraying systems work independently, lacking synchronization. In rural regions, poor internet infrastructure further hampers the adoption of smart farming technologies. These challenges highlight the need for a unified, intelligent system that can automate, analyze, and act in real time without relying heavily on human input or high-speed connectivity.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    The third objective is to automate pesticide and fertilizer spraying based on real-time disease detection data. A smart spraying drone uses the GPS coordinates provided by the monitoring drone to apply treatments precisely to affected areas. A memory-based control mechanism ensures that already-treated zones are not revisited, reducing chemical waste, lowering costs, and promoting sustainable farming practices.

              <p>The proposed Smart Dragri System is composed of four major components working in an integrated manner to automate agricultural monitoring, disease detection, pesticide application, and secure communication. These four core components are:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Autonomous Drone Navigation and Crop Disease Detection.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>IoT-Based Soil Monitoring and Real-Time Communication.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Automated Precision Pesticide Spraying.</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Cloud-Based Dashboard and Encrypted Monitoring System.</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p> The Smart Dragri System is built as a modular, automated platform integrating drone simulation, IoT-based soil monitoring, precision pesticide spraying, and real-time secure communication. The drone, developed using Python and the A* path-planning algorithm, autonomously navigates agricultural fields while avoiding obstacles and capturing images. Using basic image processing, it detects crop diseases and maps affected areas with simulated GPS coordinates. Meanwhile, soil health is monitored using Raspberry Pi and NPK sensors, which transmit real-time data to a Firebase cloud database via LoRa communication ideal for long-range, low-power use in rural farms. </p>
            <p>Once disease locations are identified, an automated spray drone receives the GPS data and applies pesticides only where necessary using a memory-based mapping system to avoid redundant spraying. Farmers access a web or mobile dashboard that visualizes drone activity, soil conditions, and treatment zones in real time. The entire system is secured with AES-128 encryption, ensuring reliable and private communication between components. All operations are managed through a centralized Flask-based backend, enabling the coordination of drone navigation, data collection, spraying actions, and dashboard updates delivering an efficient, scalable, and smart agriculture solution. </p>
